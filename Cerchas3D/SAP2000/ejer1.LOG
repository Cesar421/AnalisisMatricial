 BASIC STABILITY CHECK FOR LINEAR LOAD CASES:
    NUMBER OF NEGATIVE STIFFNESS EIGENVALUES SHOULD BE ZERO FOR STABILITY.
    (NOTE: FURTHER CHECKS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS DEEMED NECESSARY,
     SUCH AS REVIEWING EIGEN MODES FOR MECHANISMS AND RIGID-BODY MOTION)

 CHECK THE STRUCTURE CAREFULLY FOR:
 - INADEQUATE SUPPORT CONDITIONS, OR
 - ONE OR MORE INTERNAL MECHANISMS, OR
 - ZERO OR NEGATIVE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - EXTREMELY LARGE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - BUCKLING DUE TO P-DELTA OR GEOMETRIC NONLINEARITY, OR
 - A FREQUENCY SHIFT (IF ANY) ONTO A NATURAL FREQUENCY
